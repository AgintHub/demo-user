  compose_prd_summary:
    agent: false
    description: Create a PRD executive summary referencing all prior outputs.

    - description: Executive summary for the PRD document, synthesizing objective,
        users, and features.
      key: prd_summary
      type: str
    prompt: Write an executive summary for the PRD that succinctly combines the core
      objective, user roles, key features, and their descriptions. The summary should
      present a clear overview to an executive reader. Do not include metrics, constraints,
      or risks here.
  extract_constraints:
    agent: false

    - description: List of explicit technical or business constraints applicable to
        the workflow.
      key: constraints
      type: List[str]
    prompt: Read the provided requirements and list all explicit technical or business
      constraints (such as regulatory, platform limitations, deadlines, etc) that
      must be satisfied by the PRD. Omit any implied or unstated constraints.
  extract_key_features:
    agent: false
    description: Generate a list of key functional features required by the workflow.
    name: extract_key_features
    nodes_depended_on:
    - identify_core_objective
    nodes_dependent_on: []
    output_structure:
    - description: Names of fundamental workflow features required in the PRD.
      key: feature_names
      type: List[str]
    prompt: Examining the requirements and core objective, extract the main features
      that the PRD should address. Each feature should be a standalone, functional
      capability with no overlap.
  generate_feature_descriptions:
    agent: false
    description: Write a concise, one-sentence description for each feature.
    name: generate_feature_descriptions
    nodes_depended_on:
    - extract_key_features
    nodes_dependent_on: []
    output_structure:
    - description: Concise description for each feature, aligned with feature_names.
      key: feature_descriptions
      type: List[str]
    prompt: For each key feature, provide a one-sentence description that clearly
      and concisely describes the purpose or functionality of that feature within
      the workflow.
  identify_core_objective:
    agent: false
    description: Extract the single core objective of the workflow based on provided
      requirements.
    name: identify_core_objective
    nodes_depended_on: []
    nodes_dependent_on: []
    output_structure:
    - description: The primary objective statement for the workflow as described in
        the requirements.
      key: core_objective
      type: str
    prompt: Read the workflow requirements and identify the singular core objective
      that this PRD document should accomplish. Focus only on distilling the main
      purpose into a single sentence.
  identify_major_risks:
    agent: false
    description: List significant risks or uncertainties associated with the workflow.
    name: identify_major_risks
    nodes_depended_on: []
    nodes_dependent_on: []
    output_structure:
    - description: Significant risks or uncertainties for delivery or adoption of
        the workflow.
      key: major_risks
      type: List[str]
    prompt: Identify and list any major risks, uncertainties, or dependencies that
      could affect the successful delivery of this workflow. Focus only on those that
      are actionable or noteworthy for a PRD.
  identify_success_metrics:
    agent: false
    description: List measurable success criteria (quantitative or qualitative) for
      the workflow.
    name: identify_success_metrics
    nodes_depended_on:
    - identify_core_objective
    nodes_dependent_on: []
    output_structure:
    - description: List of measurable success metrics or acceptance criteria.
      key: success_metrics
      type: List[str]
    prompt: Based on the core objective, identify and enumerate the main success metrics
      for the workflow. Each metric should be stated as a measurable goal or observable
      outcome directly tied to the objective.
  list_primary_user_roles:
    agent: false
    description: Determine all primary user roles or personas that will interact with
      the workflow.
    name: list_primary_user_roles
    nodes_depended_on:
    - identify_core_objective
    nodes_dependent_on: []
    output_structure:
    - description: List of primary user roles or personas interacting with the workflow.
      key: user_roles
      type: List[str]
    prompt: Analyze the core objective and requirements to list all distinct user
      roles or personas who will directly interact with or benefit from this workflow.
      Focus on explicit roles and avoid inferring unstated or overlapping user types.
  prioritize_features:
    agent: false
    description: Assign a unique priority ranking to each key feature.
    name: prioritize_features
    nodes_depended_on:
    - extract_key_features
    nodes_dependent_on: []
    output_structure:
    - description: Priority value for each feature, parallel with feature_names.
      key: feature_priorities
      type: List[int]
    prompt: Given the list of key features, assign a unique integer priority to each
      based strictly on its criticality to the core objective. Rank priority so that
      1 means most critical, with higher numbers for less critical features. No duplicates
      allowed.
