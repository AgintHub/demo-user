## get_expected_task_name

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Determine the source of the expected task name

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The shim needs to know where to retrieve the expected task name from, such as configuration or input parameters. |
| **Impact** | This will affect the accuracy of task name validation. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Research and analyze possible sources for the expected task name, such as configuration files or input parameters, and decide on the most suitable approach. |

#### 2. Implement a flexible retrieval mechanism

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The shim should be able to handle different sources and formats of the expected task name. |
| **Impact** | This will ensure the shim's reusability and adaptability to different use cases. |
| **Complexity** | HIGH |
| **Method** | Design a modular and extensible retrieval mechanism, potentially using a combination of configuration parsing and input parameter processing. |

#### 3. Handle edge cases and errors

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The shim should be able to handle cases where the expected task name is missing or malformed. |
| **Impact** | This will ensure the shim's robustness and reliability. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Implement basic error handling and logging mechanisms to handle edge cases and provide informative error messages. |

## validate_task_name

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Implement a string comparison function to validate the task name

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The shim needs to compare the input task name with the expected task name to determine validity |
| **Impact** | This will ensure that the task name matches the expected format, preventing potential errors downstream |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use a simple string equality check, such as Python's built-in '==' operator |

#### 2. Handle potential edge cases, such as null or empty input strings

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The shim should be robust and handle unexpected input to prevent errors |
| **Impact** | This will prevent the shim from failing unexpectedly and ensure it behaves predictably |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Use conditional statements to check for null or empty strings and return a default value or raise an exception as needed |

#### 3. Consider case sensitivity when comparing task names

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The shim should be aware of potential case differences between the input and expected task names |
| **Impact** | This will ensure that the shim correctly handles task names with different cases, such as 'TaskName' and 'taskname' |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use a case-insensitive comparison function, such as Python's built-in 'casefold()' method |
