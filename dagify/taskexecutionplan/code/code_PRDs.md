### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Validate input task name

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | This is a basic validation step that ensures the task name is correct. |
| **Impact** | LOW - This is a simple validation step that does not have a significant impact on the system. |
| **Complexity** | LOW - This step requires minimal implementation and uses standard validation algorithms. |
| **Method** | Use the `str ==` operator to compare the input task name to the name specified in the task request. |

#### 2. Output result

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | This is a straightforward output step that provides the validation result. |
| **Impact** | LOW - This is a simple output step that does not affect the system significantly. |
| **Complexity** | LOW - This step requires minimal implementation and uses standard output mechanisms. |
| **Method** | Use a `return` statement to output the result of the comparison. |
