## generate_task_id

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Implement the generate_task_id function to produce a unique identifier, such as a UUID or timestamp-based string.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | A unique task ID is essential for tracking and referencing specific tasks reliably throughout the system. |
| **Impact** | This will ensure consistent identification of tasks across different nodes and services, facilitating accurate task management. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use Python's uuid.uuid4() or a timestamp-based string to generate the ID. |

#### 2. Maintain the interface to return the generated string as the output.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Ensures the output aligns with the expected node output structure and downstream dependencies. |
| **Impact** | Provides a seamless and consistent output format for task ID generation. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Return the generated ID directly from the function to match the output schema. |

#### 3. Ensure the generated IDs are collision-resistant and sufficiently unique for the systemâ€™s scale.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Avoiding ID collisions prevents task overwrites and ensures task traceability. |
| **Impact** | Enhances reliability and integrity of task identification in the system. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Use UUID version 4 or incorporate entropy sources to maximize uniqueness. |

## request_task_decomposition

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Implement a RESTful API call to the external decomposition service.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The external service only provides a RESTful API for task decomposition. |
| **Impact** | This will allow the system to integrate with the external service and retrieve decomposition results. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Use a Python HTTP client library (e.g., requests) to send a POST request to the external service with the task description and ID. |

#### 2. Handle potential errors and exceptions from the external service.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The external service may return errors or exceptions that need to be handled. |
| **Impact** | This will ensure that the system can recover from failures and provide a meaningful error message. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions, and return a meaningful error message. |

#### 3. Implement logging and monitoring for the decomposition request.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Logging and monitoring are necessary for debugging and performance optimization. |
| **Impact** | This will allow the system to track the performance and issues with the decomposition request. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use a logging library (e.g., logging) to log the request and response, and integrate with a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus) to track performance metrics. |

## format_decomposition_result

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Handle potential errors in the decomposition result

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The decomposition result may contain errors or invalid data |
| **Impact** | Ensures the system can handle and recover from errors |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Implement try-except blocks and error logging mechanisms |

#### 2. Transform the decomposition result into a human-readable format

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The decomposition result needs to be presented to the user in a clear and understandable way |
| **Impact** | Improves user experience and facilitates understanding of the decomposition result |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use string formatting and templating techniques |

#### 3. Validate the decomposition result against a set of predefined rules

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The decomposition result must conform to specific rules and constraints |
| **Impact** | Ensures the decomposition result is valid and consistent |
| **Complexity** | HIGH |
| **Method** | Implement a validation framework using regular expressions or schema validation |
