| **Impact** | Simplifies the addition of new code validation logic, enhancing the shim's reusability and scalability. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Design an abstract base class with concrete validation methods to be implemented for different code validation techniques. |

#### 2. Establish a testing framework to ensure the shim's code validation functionality meets the required standards.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Guarantees the shim's code validation is correct and reliable, enhancing overall system trustworthiness. |
| **Impact** | Prevents potential bugs and inaccuracies that could compromise the shim's performance and user experience. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Implement unit tests for the shim's code validation logic and test its edge cases to guarantee correctness. |

#### 3. Adopt a modular architecture to facilitate the integration of future updates to the unknown code validation functionality.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Ensures seamless integration of new code validation techniques without disrupting the shim's existing functionality. |
| **Impact** | Enables efficient updates and maintenance, reducing the risk of errors and unforeseen consequences. |
| **Complexity** | HIGH |
| **Method** | Employ a microservices architecture to isolate and segment the unknown code validation logic, providing independent scalability and modularity. |
