## extract_raw_task_text

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. The shim function needs to handle variable input parameters.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The function is designed to work with a variable number of input parameters, which need to be processed and extracted. |
| **Impact** | This will allow the function to work with different types of input data, making it more versatile and reusable. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | The function can be implemented using Python's built-in support for variable keyword arguments (kwargs), which can be processed and extracted as needed. |

#### 2. The shim function needs to validate and sanitize the input data.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The function will be working with potentially untrusted input data, which needs to be validated and sanitized to prevent errors or security vulnerabilities. |
| **Impact** | This will ensure the function's stability and security, and prevent potential issues downstream. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | The function can use standard Python libraries and techniques for input validation and sanitization, such as type checking and string processing. |

#### 3. The shim function needs to provide clear and consistent output.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The function's output will be used by other parts of the system, which rely on it being accurate and consistent. |
| **Impact** | This will ensure that the function's output can be relied upon by other parts of the system, and that errors can be detected and handled. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | The function can use standard Python data structures and type hints to ensure that its output is clear and consistent. |

## normalize_task_text

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. The shim should remove special characters and punctuation from the input task text.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To ensure consistency in task text formatting, special characters and punctuation can be obstacles. |
| **Impact** | This will improve the accuracy of downstream text processing tasks. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Utilize regular expressions to replace special characters and punctuation with spaces or empty strings. |

#### 2. The shim should convert the input task text to title case.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Standardizing text case improves readability and consistency across the system. |
| **Impact** | This will enhance the overall user experience by presenting task texts in a uniform format. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use string manipulation functions to capitalize the first letter of each word and make the rest lowercase. |

#### 3. The shim should trim leading and trailing whitespace from the input task text.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Removing unnecessary whitespace ensures clean data for further processing. |
| **Impact** | This prevents errors in text processing tasks caused by extraneous spaces. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Utilize string trimming functions to remove leading and trailing whitespace. |

## extract_task_description

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. The shim function needs to accurately identify and extract the task description from the input text.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The task description is a crucial piece of information required for further processing. |
| **Impact** | Inaccurate extraction may lead to incorrect task execution or processing. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as text analysis and pattern recognition, can be used to identify and extract the task description. |

#### 2. The shim function should handle variations in input text formatting and structure.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Input texts may have different formats, structures, and levels of noise. |
| **Impact** | The shim function's robustness and accuracy will depend on its ability to handle diverse input texts. |
| **Complexity** | HIGH |
| **Method** | Machine learning models, such as text classification or sequence tagging models, can be trained to handle variations in input text. |

#### 3. The shim function should provide a mechanism for feedback and improvement.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The shim function's performance may degrade over time due to changes in input text patterns. |
| **Impact** | A feedback mechanism will enable the shim function to adapt to changing input patterns and improve its performance. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | A simple logging and review process can be implemented to collect feedback and update the shim function's models or rules. |

## format_description

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Implement data cleaning and normalization techniques to remove unnecessary characters and convert the task description to lowercase.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To ensure consistency in the formatted description and improve readability. |
| **Impact** | The formatted description will be consistent and easier to understand. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Use Python's built-in string methods such as `strip()`, `lower()`, and `replace()` to perform data cleaning and normalization. |

#### 2. Develop a set of rules to format the task description into a standardized output based on the input task description.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To ensure that the output is consistent with the expected format. |
| **Impact** | The output will be consistent and easier to process by downstream nodes. |
| **Complexity** | HIGH |
| **Method** | Use a combination of regular expressions and string manipulation techniques to develop a set of rules for formatting the task description. |

#### 3. Test the format_description node to ensure that it produces consistent and accurate outputs for different input task descriptions.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To ensure that the node functions correctly in all scenarios. |
| **Impact** | The node will produce accurate and consistent outputs, reducing the risk of errors downstream. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use a combination of unit tests and integration tests to verify the node's functionality and correctness. |
