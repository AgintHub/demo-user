## clean_decomposition_text

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Implement a natural language processing (NLP) library such as NLTK or spaCy to pre-process and clean the text.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To improve the accuracy of the text normalization and cleaning process. |
| **Impact** | The pre-processing step will improve the accuracy of the text normalization and cleaning process, leading to better results in the downstream steps. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Utilize the built-in functions in the chosen NLP library to remove special characters, punctuation, and convert the text to lowercase. |

#### 2. Develop a set of rules or algorithms to match and replace specific patterns or phrases in the text.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To remove specific patterns or phrases that are not relevant to the decomposition process. |
| **Impact** | The text cleaning step will remove irrelevant patterns or phrases, ensuring the decomposition result is focused on the essential information. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Use a combination of regular expressions and string manipulation techniques to identify and replace the specific patterns or phrases. |

#### 3. Evaluate and optimize the text cleaning and normalization process to ensure it meets the requirements of the decomposition result.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To ensure the output of the text cleaning and normalization step meets the requirements of the decomposition process. |
| **Impact** | The optimization step will improve the quality of the decomposition result, leading to better accuracy and reliability in the downstream steps. |
| **Complexity** | HIGH |
| **Method** | Use manual evaluation and testing to assess the performance of the text cleaning and normalization process, then iterate and optimize the process as needed. |

## extract_steps_from_text

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. The shim function should utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and extract steps from the input text.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The input text may contain multiple steps and/or complex sentences that need to be parsed and broken down into individual steps. |
| **Impact** | The accuracy of the extracted steps will directly affect the downstream processing and validation of the fundamental steps. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Use a library such as spaCy or Stanford CoreNLP to perform sentence tokenization and dependency parsing to identify step-like structures in the text. |

#### 2. The shim function should handle variations in step formatting, such as bullet points, numbered lists, or paragraphs with multiple steps.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The input text may not always follow a standard format, and the shim function needs to be able to adapt to different structures. |
| **Impact** | The ability to handle variations in step formatting will improve the robustness and accuracy of the extracted steps. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use regular expressions or string manipulation techniques to normalize the input text and identify step boundaries. |

#### 3. The shim function should output a list of extracted steps in a standardized format.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | The output of the shim function will be used as input for downstream processing and validation, and a standardized format will facilitate integration with other components. |
| **Impact** | A standardized output format will improve the efficiency and accuracy of downstream processing and validation. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Use a simple data structure such as a list of strings to represent the extracted steps, and ensure that each step is a self-contained string. |

## normalize_steps

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. The shim function should handle inconsistent step formatting by standardizing verb conjugations and removing redundant phrases.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To ensure uniformity in step representation, which is crucial for downstream processing and analysis. |
| **Impact** | Improved accuracy and reliability of subsequent operations that rely on step data. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** | Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, to identify and normalize verb conjugations and remove redundant phrases. |

#### 2. The shim function should be able to handle steps with varying levels of granularity, from high-level actions to detailed sub-steps.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To accommodate diverse input data and facilitate flexible analysis and processing. |
| **Impact** | Enhanced flexibility and adaptability of the system to different input formats and data sources. |
| **Complexity** | HIGH |
| **Method** | Implement a hierarchical or graph-based approach to represent and normalize steps with varying levels of granularity, allowing for efficient merging and splitting of steps as needed. |

#### 3. The shim function should include robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure reliable operation and facilitate debugging.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | To guarantee the shim function's stability and maintainability in a production environment. |
| **Impact** | Reduced downtime and improved maintainability of the system. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
| **Method** | Integrate try-except blocks and logging libraries (e.g., Python's built-in logging module) to catch and report errors, and provide informative error messages for debugging purposes. |

## validate_fundamental_steps

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Implement a set of predefined validation rules to filter out invalid or irrelevant steps.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Ensure that the extracted steps are accurate and relevant to the task. |
| **Impact** | Improved accuracy and relevance of extracted steps. |
| **Complexity** | MEDIUM |
| **Method** |  Utilize a rule-based approach, where each rule is implemented as a separate function that takes the input parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the rule is satisfied. The output will be filtered based on the results of these functions. |

#### 2. Develop a data structure to store and manage the validation rules, allowing for easy addition and removal of rules.

| Category | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason** | Enable flexibility and scalability in the validation process. |
| **Impact** | Easier maintenance and updates of validation rules. |
| **Complexity** | LOW |
