    nodes_dependent_on: []
    prompt: Using the verified test conditions, simulate the rocket science experiment.
      Report the results of the simulation, focusing on the key performance indicators,
      such as rocket trajectory, velocity, and safety margins.
  verify_test_conditions:
    agent: false
    description: Verify that the test conditions meet the specified requirements
    name: verify_test_conditions
    nodes_depended_on:
    - define_test_parameters
    nodes_dependent_on: []
    prompt: Using the test parameters identified, verify that the test conditions
      meet the specified requirements. Focus on checking if the conditions align with
      the experiment design and stated objectives, and report any discrepancies.
