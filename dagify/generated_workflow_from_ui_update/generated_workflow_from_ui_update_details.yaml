      - complexity: MEDIUM - Requires understanding of diffing algorithms and workflow
          structures
        impact: HIGH - Accurate identification of changes is crucial for correct workflow
          updates
        method: Use a library like difflib for computing differences between the updated
          requirements and existing workflow
        reason: This approach enables efficient identification of necessary changes
        text: Implement a requirements diffing algorithm to compare the updated requirements
          with the existing workflow
      - complexity: LOW - Can be implemented using standard validation techniques
        impact: HIGH - Incomplete or inconsistent requirements can lead to incorrect
          workflow updates
        method: Use a schema validation library to check the updated requirements
          against a predefined schema
        reason: Ensures that the updated requirements are accurate and can be used
          for workflow updates
        text: Validate the updated requirements for completeness and consistency
      - complexity: LOW - Can be implemented using simple conditional logic
        impact: MEDIUM - Incorrect categorization can lead to incorrect updates
        method: Use a decision tree or a set of conditional statements to categorize
          changes
        reason: This categorization enables targeted updates to the workflow
        text: Categorize necessary changes into additions, modifications, and deletions
    prompt: Based on the updated requirements, determine which changes need to be
      made to the existing workflow. Identify any necessary additions, modifications,
      or deletions.

      - complexity: MEDIUM - Requires careful implementation but uses standard patterns
        impact: HIGH - This node is critical to ensuring the quality of the updated
          workflow
        method: Use a checklist-based approach to verify the workflow against the
          requirements
        reason: This ensures the accuracy and completeness of the updated workflow
        text: Implement a thorough review process to ensure the updated workflow meets
          the requirements
      - complexity: LOW - Simple logging or reporting mechanism
        impact: MEDIUM - Important for auditability and debugging
        method: Use a standardized issue tracking template
        reason: This allows for transparent tracking and resolution of issues
        text: Develop a mechanism to document any issues or discrepancies found during
          review
      - complexity: LOW - Simple status output
        impact: LOW - Useful for workflow management
        method: Use a standard status code enumeration

        text: Implement a verification status output to indicate the result of the
          review
    prompt: Carefully review and verify the updated workflow to ensure all changes
      are correct and it meets the updated requirements. Document any issues or discrepancies.
