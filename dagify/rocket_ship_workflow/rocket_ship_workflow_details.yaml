      - complexity: MEDIUM - Requires careful planning and design, but can be achieved
          with standard software engineering practices.
        impact: HIGH - This will affect the overall maintainability and scalability
          of the system.
        method: Use a service-oriented architecture (SOA) approach to define the modules
          and their interactions.
        reason: A modular architecture will allow for easier troubleshooting and modification
          of individual components without affecting the entire system.
        text: Implement a modular architecture for the integrated system to enable
          easy maintenance and updates.
      - complexity: HIGH - Requires expertise in computer networking and real-time
          systems.
        impact: HIGH - This will directly affect the performance and safety of the
          rocket ship.
        method: Use a publish-subscribe pattern with a message queue to handle communication
          between the systems.
        reason: A well-defined synchronization protocol is crucial to prevent data
          inconsistencies and ensure accurate control of the rocket ship.
        text: Develop a synchronization protocol to ensure seamless communication
          between the propulsion and guidance systems.
      - complexity: MEDIUM - Requires understanding of the system's control requirements
          and interface design principles.
        impact: HIGH - This will directly affect the controllability and stability
          of the rocket ship.
        method: Use a finite state machine (FSM) to model the control interfaces and
          ensure deterministic behavior.
        reason: Control interfaces are necessary to translate high-level commands
          into specific actions for each system.
        text: Implement control interfaces for the propulsion and guidance systems
          to enable coordinated control.
      - complexity: HIGH - Requires careful design and implementation to ensure effective
          redundancy without excessive complexity.
        impact: HIGH - This will directly affect the safety and reliability of the
          rocket ship.
        method: Use a combination of hardware and software redundancy, such as duplicate
          components and error-correcting codes.
        reason: Redundancy features are essential to ensure the reliability and fault
          tolerance of the integrated system.
        text: Incorporate redundancy features to ensure continued operation in case
          of component failure.
      - complexity: HIGH - Requires extensive testing and validation efforts, including
          simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing.
        impact: HIGH - This will directly affect the safety and performance of the
          rocket ship.
        method: Use a model-based testing approach with automated test case generation
          and execution.
        reason: Validation and testing are crucial to ensure that the integrated system
          meets the required specifications and performs as expected.
